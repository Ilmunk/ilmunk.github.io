== About me
I am a research associate in the [https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk Statistical Laboratory] at the [https://www.cam.ac.uk University of Cambridge] advised by Professor [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/ Richard Samworth] and [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/ Rajen Shah]. Prior to joining the University of Cambridge, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics and Data Science at [http://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University] advised by Professor [http://stat.cmu.edu/~larry Larry Wasserman] and [http://stat.cmu.edu/~siva Sivaraman Balakrishnan].

My research interests are broadly in the areas of high-dimensional statistics, nonparametric inference and statistical learning theory. Currently my focus is on developing and understanding distribution-free and robust methods applied to hypothesis testing problems. I am also interested in asymptotic theory, concentration of measure and minimax theory as tools for resolving and understanding modern statistical problems.
