== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the [http://stat.cmu.edu/ Department of Statistics and Data Science] at [http://www.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon University] advised by [http://stat.cmu.edu/~larry Larry Wasserman] and [http://stat.cmu.edu/~siva Sivaraman Balakrishnan]. My research interests are broadly in the areas of high-dimensional statistics, nonparametric inference and statistical learning theory. Currently my focus is on developing and understanding distribution-free and robust methods applied to hypothesis testing problems. I am also interested in asymptotic theory, concentration of measure and minimax theory as tools for resolving and understanding modern statistical problems. I am also lucky to have worked with [http://stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/ Aaditya Ramdas], [http://stat.cmu.edu/~annlee/ Ann Lee], [http://stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/ Jing Lei] and [http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/ Peter Freeman] during my Ph.D.
